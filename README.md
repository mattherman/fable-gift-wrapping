# Gift Wrapping

This was a project created for [F# Advent 2020](https://sergeytihon.com/2020/10/22/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2020/). It is an implementation of the [Gift Wrapping algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm) for finding convex hulls in a 2D space. It was written in F# and compiled to Javascript using [Fable](https://fable.io).

There are multiple implementations in `GiftWrapping.fs` showing what the algorithm looks like written in an imperative style (mirroring the pseudocode) and a functional style.
